# Pairs-Trading
  An approach that takes advantage of the mispricing between 2 or more co-moving assets, by taking the long position in one (many) and shorting the other(s), betting that the relationship will hold and that the relationship will hold and that prices will converge.
  Pairs trading is a subset of statistical arbitrage 
    Statistical arbitrage: entails factor investing and mean reverting portfolio 
  Statistical arbitrage and pairs trading try to solve the problem, approximating if the asset is truly over and undervalued, using price relativity

## 3 Steps to building a pairs trading strategy
1. Pairs selecting: e.g. using cointegration, correlation, Kendall Tau correlation
2. Spread modelling: Model the spread in a way that maximises mean reversion (a financial theory that states that an asset's price will tend to converge to the average price over time) and ensures market neutrality of the strategy
3. Trading rules: Established based on the type of utilised approach and the spread behaviour
